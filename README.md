Meet Your Client: Cibus
Week 1 - Meet cibus

Meet Cibus

Cibus is an LLC (Limited Liability Company) that wants to create a responsive website, along with an android, and IOS app that helps consumers plan meals that are both healthy and use environmental sustainable strategies and small business ecosystems.  

Cibus recognizes the time and resources that are required to both eat healthy as well as search and find ingredients that are sourced from sustainable and small businesses, so the owners of the venture have employed your team to help build out their digital delivery deliverables.

    Nourishing 
    Ingredients from locally sourced providers
    Fair trade products and ingredients
    Sustainable strategies

Cibus has retained you as a freelance full stack developer to create a website for them.  The mobile apps are out of scope, but the back-end database structure and APIs should be built robust enough to assume mobile devices will use them as well.

The website and app should include the following features:

    User management
        Customers
        Administrators
        Business Partners and Ingredient Providers
    Ability for End User to Create and Manage Recipes
    A monthly menu planner along with the ability to adjust the recipe ingredients for different serving amounts
    Ability for Business Providers to Add ingredients for recipes
        You will need to match up the ingredients in customer recipes with ingredients the business provides have available

You will build out the back-end and API once

You will build the front end using two frameworks:  Angular and React
